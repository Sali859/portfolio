            <p> I started playing tennis because my older sister did, but once I started playing with her,
                I realized it was a lot of fun becuase I could express myself by hitting the ball hard.

            <p>
               I enjoy cooking and trying new foods. Baking, on the other hand, is something I enjoy doing for fun.
               I simply enjoy experimenting with ingredients and decorating my cakes. BON APPETIT.

            <p>I'm in a computer science class, and I saw a poster on the wall with a barcode to join the classroom of girls who 
               code club, and I felt like I belonged there, so I just joined. My favorite activity is finch robot and coding for

            <h2>🌏Multicultural Club🌏</h2>
            <p>
               When you move to America and don't speak English, the first thing your school does is enroll you in an ENL program. 
               That's how I learned about the multicultural club: my teacher signed me up for a program hosted by our school's 
               Spanish teacher. The best thing we did was a Ukraine fundraiser.  </p>
