                    <h3>Tigrinya</h3>
                    <p>This is my native language. I've been speaking this language since I first started talking.
                         I don't speak it during the day, but when I get home, I speak it to my family and friends.</p>

                    <h3>Arabic</h3>
                    <p>Arabic is my second language. I learned Arabic because I attended an Islamic private school to 
                        study Arabic and religion. When I immigrated to Sudan, that's where I really started speaking Arabic.</p>

                    <h3>Amharic</h3>
                    <p>Amharic is my third language. I immigrated to Ethiopia from Sudan when I was ten years old, 
                        and I had to attend school until the process was completed by the American embassy and I could come 
                        to the United States. And I learned Amharic by going to school.</p>

                    <h3>English</h3>
                    <p>English is my fourth language. Finally, after four years In Ethiopia, I came to the United State 
                        and the first state I have been to was Louisiana. I started the next year I arrived, 
                        in the 8th grade in Baton Rouge. I pretty much learn English as the other language by going to school.</p>

                    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript was my first actual coding environment, and before that, I was coding on a website called BrBytes.
                         BrBytes is an LSU student who created a coding environment. As a result, there wasn't much to do. 
                         I used javaScript from code.org last year with block code and it was easy and fun.</p>

                    <h3>Html</h3>
                    <p>I only started doing HTML a few weeks ago. When you write HTML without CSS, it doesn't look good.
                         So I feel you have to do two works which is a lot. I'm more confident in HTML than in CSS and Jquery..</p>

                    <h3>Css</h3>
                    <p>I only started doing CSS a few weeks ago. Css, I believe, is the most fun while also requiring 
                        the most work. This is due to the fact that you get to do the fun colors, but then you have 
                        to place items all over the position and try ten times.</p>

                    <h3>jQuery</h3>
                    <p>jQuery is the most recent and least complex thing I've developed.
                         It's a fantastic code to use for any page because it allows for web interaction such as 
                         clicking buttons and I love how you have to $. </p>
